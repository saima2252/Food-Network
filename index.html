        <p>“Cooking is not difficult. Everyone has taste, even if they don’t realize it. Even if you’re not a great
            chef, there’s nothing to stop you understanding the difference between what tastes good and what doesn’t.”
            – Gerard Depardieu</p>

            <h3>Chinese Food</h3>
            <p>Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or colors, there are
                only so many flavors—it’s how you combine them that sets you apart</p>

            <h3>Korean Food</h3>
            <p>If you are a chef, no matter how good a chef you are, it’s not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in
                cooking for others. It’s the same with music.</p>
